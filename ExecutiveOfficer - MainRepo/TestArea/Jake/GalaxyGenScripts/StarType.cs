public enum StarType {
    CLASS_O, //UV Star -- very rare -- massive stars -- very hot -- may damage ships in system, even with shields and through armor
    CLASS_B, //Blue Luminous -- silicon mentioned -- unusual properties of faster rotations around, maybe introduces issues with ship control?
    CLASS_A, //White/BlueWhite -- ionized metals -- ~1 in 160
    CLASS_G, //Yellow -- neutral metals -- ~1 in 13 -- our sun is classed a g star
    CLASS_K, //Orange -- best chance of life -- neutral metals
    CLASS_M, //Red Dwarf - 76% of main sequence stars are m -- lower neutral metals, oxide visible
    CLASS_L, //Brown Dwarf - dark red in color -- low gravity of star -- alkali metals prominent
    CLASS_C, //Carbon star - nearly dead start -- high amounts of carbon from burned material present in atmosphere -- usually giants or super giants
    NEUTRON //Dead star - small and cold -- larger it is, more neutrino flux carried

public enum StarType {
    ClassO, //UV Star -- very rare -- massive stars -- very hot -- may damage ships in system, even with shields and through armor
    ClassB, //Blue Luminous -- silicon mentioned -- unusual properties of faster rotations around, maybe introduces issues with ship control?
    ClassA, //White/BlueWhite -- ionized metals -- ~1 in 160
    ClassG, //Yellow -- neutral metals -- ~1 in 13 -- our sun is classed a g star
    ClassK, //Orange -- best chance of life -- neutral metals
    ClassM, //Red Dwarf - 76% of main sequence stars are m -- lower neutral metals, oxide visible
    ClassL, //Brown Dwarf - dark red in color -- low gravity of star -- alkali metals prominent
    ClassC, //Carbon star - nearly dead start -- high amounts of carbon from burned material present in atmosphere -- usually giants or super giants
    Neutron //Dead star - small and cold -- larger it is, more neutrino flux carried
